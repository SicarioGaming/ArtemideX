## Update (23 Oct)

Hey everyone - thank you so much for giving Starwire a chance, and for all of the meaningful feedback I've received thus far. I may never beat the "AI/Vibecoded Slop" allegations fully, but I promise to keep trying with my chin up haha.

After [u/rambo3349](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonlightStreaming/comments/1xd12x5/starwire_020_mic_passthrough_wo_needing_to_modify/19rigium2zrt0/) reviewed Starwire's code and GitHub repo, I made a bunch of changes to hopefully resolve some of those issues. If there are any further issues with the code or Github repo, I will prepare a smaller release to address them (ex. 0.2.2) as opposed to making you guys wait for the next major release (0.3.0, which I am targeting for early next week).

In the longer-term pipeline (0.4.0), I noticed a lot of users are connecting from an Ayn Thor or similar DS device. I'm actually super jealous, my Thor should arrive in the next month and on that front I'm wondering what you guys would like to see in terms of "DS features" in future Starwire releases.

Aside from that, here are the draft release notes for 0.2.1 which should go live tonight:

<details open>
<summary><b>Draft release notes for 0.2.1</b></summary>

**Following u/rambo3349's code review (already live on GitHub):**

- **Real commit history:** every commit now has its own description, and the repo shares history with Moonlight X again, so upstream updates can be merged properly.
- **Prebuilt libraries:** every one is traced back to its source and rebuilt byte for byte by GitHub ([PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md)).
- **Clearer about what's experimental:** the custom Turnip driver is now described as an experimental option, not listed with the speed features.
- **Mic measurements:** the 0.2.0 numbers are published with the raw data and a script that recomputes them ([here](docs/measurements/2026-10-22-mic/)), with two rounded numbers corrected.
- **Security and contributing:** a [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) with private vulnerability reporting, and a [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Checksums** are on the release pages, so you can check your download.

**What's new in 0.2.1:**

- **Encrypted microphone:** the mic is now encrypted, and only devices you've paired can send audio to your PC. Being on the same network is no longer enough, and encryption no longer requires Tailscale or a similar VPN.
- **Less mic delay:** the PC side plays through a faster Windows audio path. In my tests the median delay dropped from about 114 to 98 ms, with far fewer dropouts.
- **The mic setup window** fits small screens, like a 1280x720 stream.
- **Custom resolutions and frame rates,** in the main settings and per game. These come from Moonlight X, credited to them.
- **An about page** with credits and the full open-source licences.
- **The custom driver option** is marked experimental, with a plain warning before you turn it on.
- Various other small cleanups to the Github repo and changes to wording for transparency.

**Fixes**

- The PC's cursor comes back if Starwire is closed or crashes while it's hidden, and there's a "Fix PC cursor" button in the stream menu.
- No more "PC not paired" flicker on the games screen.
- No more crash on RedMagic devices when the games screen resizes.
- No more crashes from some unusual host replies, or on the resume button on Android 5 and 6.
- A rare video mix-up with async decoding after a hiccup is fixed.
- On Android 5 to 7, the background animations now stop when animations are turned off (saves battery).
- The in-stream menu and the games screen fit small screens better.

**Testing and Development**

- 292 unit tests (from none), about 135 on-device tests and 32 screenshot tests.
- The same tests also run on 5 virtual devices, including a Fold shape folded, half-open and unfolded. (Thank you to u/MickeyBronson)
- Checks run automatically on every change.

**Known issues**

- Right-to-left languages (Hebrew, Persian) show translated text, but the layout doesn't mirror yet.
- On very narrow screens, the Quit and Disconnect buttons can cut their labels short.
- The custom Turnip driver option still hasn't been tried with a real Turnip driver.

</details>

Thank you all for your continued trust and engagement. Please keep an eye out for announcements re: 0.2.1. Cheers!

## New in 0.2.0: your microphone on the PC, with any host

Mic passthrough was a highly requested feature after the 0.1.0 launch, and one of the last things
keeping a Moonlight stream from feeling like you're really sitting at your PC. Parsec has had it
for years, but with Moonlight it meant switching your PC to a host build that has a mic channel,
like logabell's Apollo fork. Most of us don't want to swap host programs, and I wasn't keen on
giving up a Vibepollo setup that already works flawlessly.

So this works without touching the host: Starwire sends your mic straight to the PC as VBAN
(VB-Audio's network audio format), a small receiver plays it into VB-Cable, a free virtual
microphone, and Discord or the game picks it up as a normal mic. Vibepollo, Sunshine and Apollo
stay exactly as they are, and the mic starts and stops with the stream, with no separate mic app
like WO Mic or AudioRelay to open on your Android device each time.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/mic-signal-path.png" width="820" alt="Starwire 0.2.0's microphone path: on Android, AudioRecord with echo cancelling and noise suppression feeds VbanSender, which sends 48 kHz 16-bit mono packets over UDP port 6980 to StarwireMicReceiver on the Windows PC, which plays them into VB-Cable's CABLE Input; Discord or the game records from CABLE Output. The Moonlight stream between Starwire and the host is unchanged.">
<br>
<sub>This is 0.2.0's path. From 0.2.1 each VBAN packet travels encrypted inside Starwire's SWMC format, and the receiver only plays audio from devices you've paired, through WASAPI. How it works, below, has the details.</sub>
</p>

1. On the PC, download **Starwire-Microphone-for-Windows.zip** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/SicarioGaming/Starwire/releases/latest), unzip it and
   double-click `setup-microphone.cmd`. It needs nothing installed first: it builds the receiver
   with the compiler that comes with Windows, downloads VB-Cable from VB-Audio if you don't have it
   (and checks VB-Audio signed it), lets the receiver through the firewall for local and private VPN
   addresses only, starts it when you sign in and checks the virtual mic works. The receiver has no window, just an icon by
   the clock. [Full guide](windows/README.md).
2. In Discord or the game, choose **CABLE Output** as the microphone.
3. In Starwire: **Settings → Sound & vibration → Send my microphone**.
4. Pair them, once: on the PC, right-click the receiver's icon by the clock, choose **Pair a
   device...**, then **Show the code**. In Starwire, tap **Pair with the PC** under Send my
   microphone, pick the PC and type the code.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/mic-setup.png" width="720" alt="The microphone setup finishing in a PowerShell window: the receiver installed in Program Files, VB-Cable found, the firewall rule added for local-network and private VPN addresses, the receiver started with no window (just an icon by the clock), and the check reporting that the microphone heard the test tone.">
<br>
<sub>All of this is automatic: one double-click runs the PowerShell setup, which builds and starts the receiver, installs VB-Cable if it's missing, adds the firewall rule and checks the virtual mic. This is it finishing on my PC.</sub>
</p>

The receiver has no window: right-click its icon by the clock to pair a device, see the paired
devices, check the virtual mic, play a test tone for Discord's mic test or quit (or end it in Task
Manager). Measured with 0.2.0, before the encryption, on my tablet over Wi-Fi: 16,880 packets in
90 seconds with none lost, no gaps in the receiver's buffer (usually 30 to 50 ms queued) and about
0.85 Mbps of upload. The raw data and a script that recomputes every number are in
[docs/measurements](docs/measurements/2026-10-22-mic/).

**Please read this before you use it.** From 0.2.1 the microphone is encrypted, and the receiver
only plays audio from devices you've paired with that PC. Being on the same network is no longer
enough to listen to it or to send sound into your PC's virtual mic, and the encryption doesn't
need Tailscale or a VPN like it. Three things to know:

- **Updating from 0.2.0 needs both sides:** the app and the PC setup, then pairing once. A 0.2.0
  receiver won't understand the new app, and the new receiver refuses 0.2.0's unencrypted audio.
- **Don't show the pairing code while your screen is shared.** Anyone who sees it before you've
  typed it could pair instead of you.
- **"Not encrypted"**, the option for Voicemeeter and other VBAN apps, sends plain VBAN, like 0.2.0
  did. Anyone on the same network can listen to that or send sound into it, so use it only on a
  network you trust. Starwire's receiver only plays plain VBAN if you set it up with
  `-AllowUnencrypted`, and then anyone on the network can send sound into it too.

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) says what the encryption protects against and what it doesn't. If your
PC runs [logabell's Apollo build](https://github.com/logabell/apollo-microphone/releases), you can
send the mic over the stream itself instead.

**Encrypted, and only from paired devices.** You pair each Android device with the PC once: the
receiver shows a 16-character code and you type it into Starwire (**Settings → Sound & vibration
→ Send my microphone → Pair with the PC**). The code authenticates a key exchange, so the device
and the PC end up with a key nobody else on the network has. Each stream then gets its own
AES-256-GCM key, every packet is encrypted and authenticated with a counter that only goes up,
and the receiver refuses anything it can't check: devices it hasn't paired, recorded packets sent
again, and plain VBAN.

What's tested: the app and the receiver give the same bytes for a shared set of test vectors, the
app's pairing and sender work against the receiver on one PC's loopback (every packet played in
order, a replayed, a late, two forged and one plain VBAN packet refused), and the app's side runs
on my tablet, where encrypting took about 6.5 microseconds per packet in a benchmark. On 23 Oct I
streamed from my tablet to my PC over Wi-Fi with a receiver that only takes encrypted audio, and
the sound came through only while the stream ran. I didn't count dropouts in that test. The format
is in [docs/dev/mic-protocol.md](docs/dev/mic-protocol.md).

<details>
<summary><b>How it works and what I measured</b></summary>

<br>

On the Android device, Starwire records with `AudioRecord` using the `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` source and turns
on the platform echo canceller and noise suppressor where the device has them. It reads 20 ms at a
time and makes 48 kHz 16-bit mono PCM into VBAN packets: a 28-byte header and 256 samples per
packet, 187.5 packets a second. Each one is encrypted inside Starwire's SWMC format (584 bytes
with its header and tag) and sent over UDP (port 6980 by default); the "Not encrypted" option sends
the plain VBAN packets instead. It sends to the PC you're streaming from, so there's no address to
type in, and it doesn't ask the host for a mic channel.

On the PC, `StarwireMicReceiver` (two C# files, built on your PC from the source in the zip)
plays a packet only if it comes from a paired device, checks out under that stream's key and has
a higher counter than any it has played. As an extra layer it still only takes packets from
local-network or private VPN addresses (a filter, not a security check). It plays into CABLE Input
through WASAPI, in 2.7 ms steps on VB-Cable, and uses waveOut's 10 ms blocks (as 0.2.0 did) if
WASAPI doesn't work. Playback starts once 40 ms is queued and never falls more than 120 ms behind.
The device's and the PC's clocks drift apart (about 60 ppm in my test), so the receiver notes how
low the buffer gets in the first 2 seconds, and when it then stays 10 ms or more above that for 2
seconds, it skips 10 ms to keep the delay down (with waveOut, when it stays above 60 ms for 2
seconds).

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/mic-packet.png" width="820" alt="A real VBAN packet from the tablet's microphone as a hexdump, with each header field decoded: the VBAN marker, 48 kHz, 256 samples, mono, 16-bit PCM, the stream name Stream1 and the frame counter, followed by the 0.2.0 receiver's rules for accepting and buffering packets.">
<br>
<img src="docs/images/mic-measured.png" width="820" alt="Measurements over 90 seconds of Wi-Fi: packet arrival against the ideal schedule (p50 10.9 ms, p99 21 ms, max 38 ms), the receiver's buffer replayed from those arrivals (no underruns, nothing dropped), CABLE Output's level with no dropouts, and the PC-side delay with and without the clock-drift fix.">
<br>
<sub>The packet, the receiver's rules and the chart are from 0.2.0, before the encryption. In 0.2.1 this VBAN packet travels encrypted inside SWMC. Two notes on the chart are rounded. Checked packet by packet, the network's own spread was 6.4 ms at p99 and 21.6 ms at worst, and the buffer dipped to 20 ms a few times but never ran dry. <a href="docs/measurements/2026-10-22-mic/">The data and the script</a> give every exact number.</sub>
</p>

- With 0.2.0's waveOut playback, on the PC alone, a packet took about 107 to 119 ms to be heard
  on CABLE Output: 40 ms of buffer, the rest Windows' audio path. With WASAPI in 0.2.1, in my
  tests on the PC with recorded Wi-Fi timing, the median delay dropped from about 114 to 98 ms
  (about 7 ms less with a steady clock). I haven't measured the Android side yet.
- Echo cancelling is whatever the device provides, and some Android devices only apply it to
  calls; headphones get around that.
- The setup and receiver are Windows only for now. On Linux, PipeWire's VBAN receive module should
  take the "Not encrypted" option's stream (Stream1, UDP 6980), but I haven't tried it.
- The receiver starts when you sign in, not as a service, so it doesn't run on a PC sitting at the
  sign-in screen.

## Why I made Starwire

I have been exclusively streaming games from my headless PC to client devices for about five
years now. I recently found myself looking for a new Android client, and came upon
[MoreOrLessSoftware](https://github.com/MoreOrLessSoftware)'s
[Moonlight X](https://github.com/MoreOrLessSoftware/moonlight-android), which includes direct
frame pacing and PyroWave support. It had a noticeable impact on my stream quality, even without
using PyroWave (I don't have the connection strength to use it in practice), but I wondered how
the stream could perform if it had the Fast V-Sync, LFR, Async, and Codec options that
Artemis/Artemide has. I also missed some QoL features that the recent Windows forks have adopted
that seem to be lagging in terms of an Android client equivalent.

Back-end development started from
[Moonlight X](https://github.com/MoreOrLessSoftware/moonlight-android)'s video pipeline, adds
the touchscreen tools from [Artemide](https://github.com/derflacco/moonlight-android) and
[Artemis](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android), and picks up favourite features
from [Moonlight V+](https://github.com/qiin2333/moonlight-vplus),
[Moonlit Artemis](https://github.com/4had45/moonlit-artemis) and
[Moonlight X Turnip](https://github.com/NoCrypt/moonlight-x-turnip). I then gave it a refreshed UI
that draws from some of the trends coming out of Silicon Valley these days. It installs next to
any Moonlight you already have, so you can try it without giving anything up.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🎨 A look that follows your game
The screens take their colour from the game you've picked. Games without cover art each get
their own take on the Starwire tile, and apps like Steam Big Picture get their own icons. Your
last game is ready to go with one tap, with its stream settings right under its name, and a Quit
button sits beside Resume while it runs.

### 🎮 Everything during a stream, one tap away
Open the menu with the floating button, a three-finger tap or by holding Select on a
controller. Keyboard, full on-screen keyboard, mouse modes, zoom, key shortcuts, monitor
switching, bitrate, clipboard: it's all in one grid, and works with a controller too. Anything
that turns on and off has a small switch, so you can see what's on at a glance.

### ⚡ Low-latency video options
Moonlight X's Vulkan renderer and PyroWave codec, and the low-latency options from Artemis and
Artemide: Warp Drive, Fast V-Sync and async decoding. I ported them, but I haven't measured how
much each one saves in Starwire yet.

line under the panel says where it came from and who made it.

### 🖐 Made for touchscreens
Pinch to zoom anytime, trackpad modes, long-press to right-click, an on-screen keyboard with
every key, and the option to hide the PC's mouse pointer while you play.

### 📳 Feel the bass
Audio haptics turns a game's bass into vibration on your device or controller.

### 🎙 Your microphone on the PC
Talk in game chat or Discord through your device's microphone, **with Vibepollo, Sunshine or
Apollo as they are**: one setup script on the PC, one switch in Starwire, and a code to pair
them once. The audio is encrypted, and only devices you've paired can send it. See

## Get started

1. **Set up your PC.** I use [Vibepollo](https://github.com/Nonary/Vibepollo), and it's the only
   host I test with; it supports every feature. [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo)
   and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) should work too, since Vibepollo is built
   on them, but I haven't tried them myself. Some extras need Vibepollo or an Apollo-based host,
   and the feature tables below mark them. On Sunshine that means no clipboard sharing, PC
   commands, Virtual Display, changing the bitrate mid-stream or hiding the PC cursor.
2. **Install Starwire.** Download the latest `Starwire-…apk` from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/SicarioGaming/Starwire/releases) and open it.
3. **Pair.** Tap your PC, then type the PIN Starwire shows into your host's PIN page (usually
   `https://localhost:47990`). You only do this once.
4. **Play.** Tap a game, then **Play**.

Android 5.0+. PyroWave and the experimental custom Turnip driver option need a 64-bit ARM device.
Updates from the Releases page install over the top and keep your settings, and
[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) can keep it updated for you.

## Development

I made Starwire as a vibecoding exercise after experiencing the wonderful software that is
Vibepollo. I decided what the app should do and how it should look, and
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) wrote the code. I also
used [REA](https://github.com/morluto/rea) by morluto to look inside the other apps and see how
their features work. I test on my RedMagic Astra (Snapdragon 8 Elite, Android 16) with a GameSir
G8+, streaming from Vibepollo, and on my Galaxy Z Fold 6. The on-device tests in
`app/src/androidTest` run on the tablet. Some things haven't been tried yet: the custom
Turnip driver option with a real Turnip driver, and hosts other than Vibepollo.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) says how to build Starwire and run the tests.

The full list of changes in every version, and what's coming next, is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**2026/10/22:** [Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/SicarioGaming/Starwire/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
sends your microphone to the PC with any host (Vibepollo, Sunshine, Apollo), through a small
receiver and VB-Cable that one setup script installs. It also fits more Android devices
(settings were blank on narrow screens like a Galaxy Z Fold's cover screen, and the game screen's
header now scrolls away), adds a short "Impact:" line to the settings that affect latency and
performance, tidies the stream menu with on/off switches and a smaller floating button that
also closes it, puts a Quit button beside Resume, gives each game without cover art its own
Starwire tile, and fixes a crash when tapping a running Desktop tile. The release page has the full
list.

**2026/10/22:** [Version 0.1.2](https://github.com/SicarioGaming/Starwire/releases/tag/v0.1.2)
has been released, and fixes an error that caused the client to crash upon loading the list of
apps. To update, download the new APK and open it on your device. You will receive a prompt to
update the existing app, which will retain existing settings. Obtainium users should receive the
update automatically.

## Where every feature comes from

Each feature below says where it came from:

- **Ported from *project* (*author*)**: that project's code, brought into Starwire and adapted.
- **Idea from *project* (*author*)**: inspired by that project, but written new for Starwire.
- **New in Starwire**: written for Starwire.

Where a feature started in an older version and was carried forward (for example Artemis →
Artemide), both are named. Features marked **(Apollo / Vibepollo)** need an Apollo-based host.

<details>
<summary><b>Cover Glow, the new design</b></summary>

*New in Starwire.*

- **Game screen:** the selected game shown large with its cover, name, Play/Resume and its
  stream settings as small tags. It starts on the game running on the PC, otherwise the one you
  played last. While a game runs, Quit sits beside Resume. The top scrolls away with your games,
  leaving a slim bar with the selected game and its Play button.
- **Colours from the cover:** the background and glow take the game's cover colour and fade
  between games. White text stays readable on every colour.
- **Icons for apps without cover art:** Desktop, Steam Big Picture, Playnite and similar apps get
  an icon tile in their own colour instead of the host's plain default image. **Settings → App →
  App covers** can also use icons for every app, or only ever the PC's covers.
- **Starwire tiles for games without cover art:** each game gets its own take on the tile,
  worked out from its name (colour, ring angle, moon, glow and stars), so a row of them doesn't
  look the same.
- **A little flair:** the Starwire wordmark and the ring around the selected game slowly flow
  through a rainbow, and a starfield with a few twinkling stars sits behind the screens. Covers
  have soft rounded corners, arrive one after another and give a little when you press them, and
  the selected cover floats gently. The looping animations pause while you stream.
- **PC list:** frosted cards and a frosted quick-settings bar.
- **Settings:** section buttons that jump to each section and follow you as you scroll, plain
  section names (in English), and the Predicted impact panel on wide screens. It compares the
  choices rather than measuring them.
- **In-stream menu:** a side sheet in the game's colour with a grid of tools, usable with a
  controller.

| Feature | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Vulkan renderer with host frame timing, PyroWave codec | From Moonlight X (MoreOrLessSoftware) |
| Coming in 0.2.1: custom resolutions and frame rates. A Custom button in the resolution and frame rate lists takes any size up to 7680x4320 and any frame rate, in Settings and per game. It replaces Unlock FPS, and a saved value the device doesn't list is kept instead of being reset. Not yet tried in a stream with Starwire | From Moonlight X (MoreOrLessSoftware) |
| Custom Vulkan driver (Turnip) for PyroWave: experimental and off by default, and not yet tried with a real Turnip driver | Ported from Moonlight X Turnip (ncpt / NoCrypt), uses libadrenotools (Billy Laws / bylaws). The libadrenotools libraries in the repo were built from the upstream commit in `SOURCE`, not copied from the fork. Starwire refuses files that aren't 64-bit ARM libraries, and goes back to the system driver when one can't load or can't run PyroWave (tested with a broken file, not a real driver) |
| Warp Drive / Warp 2 frame pacing (2x / 4x FPS from the PC, newest frame shown) | Ported from Artemis (Yukino Song), via Artemide |
| Fast V-Sync (Artemide's Nano Pacer) | Ported from Artemide (derflacco) |
| V-Sync (one setting: Off, V-Sync, Fast V-Sync) | V-Sync for the direct renderer is new in Starwire; Fast V-Sync as above |
| Sync: LFR | Ported from Artemide (derflacco) |
| Async decode and Async: LFR | Ported from Artemide (derflacco) |
| Ultra Low Latency: MediaTek's own ultra-low-latency mode follows the setting, and low latency is set again after the decoder starts | Ported from Artemide (derflacco). The base option and its Snapdragon/Exynos/Amlogic flags are from Moonlight X (MoreOrLessSoftware) and Artemis |
| Virtual Display: "Display on the PC" setting, "Start in Virtual/Primary Display" **(Apollo / Vibepollo)** | Ported from Artemis (Yukino Song), via Artemide |
| Prevent Packet Loss (keeps Wi-Fi awake during streams) | Option from Artemis (Yukino Song), via Artemide; rewritten for Starwire as a small keep-alive packet |
| Lite performance overlay (one compact line: data rate, ping, decode time, dropped frames, FPS) | Ported from Axixi2233's fork (axi), via Artemis and Artemide; the plain wording is new in Starwire |
| 1% low FPS in the stats | Idea from Moonlight V+ (qiin2333) and Moonlight X Turnip (NoCrypt) |

| Pinch to zoom anytime, outside Pan/Zoom mode | Idea from Moonlit Artemis (Mohammad Forhad / 4had45); uses Artemis's pan/zoom code (Yukino Song) |
| Automatic clipboard sync (send yours when the stream starts, copy the PC's when you leave) **(Apollo / Vibepollo)** | Ported from Artemis (Yukino Song), via Artemide |
| Audio haptics: the game's bass becomes vibration on the device and/or the controller | Idea from Moonlight V+ (qiin2333); written new for Starwire |
| Hide PC cursor (never / while touching / always) **(Vibepollo)** | New in Starwire |
| Long-press to right-click in gaming trackpad mode | New in Starwire |
| Settings, the game screen and the stream menu fit more Android devices, down to narrow screens like a Galaxy Z Fold's cover screen; the game screen's header scrolls away with the covers | New in Starwire |
| An "Impact:" line under settings that change latency, smoothness, picture quality or battery | New in Starwire |
| On a foldable's inner screen, the stream follows the device instead of forcing landscape | Idea from [Moonlight Fold](https://github.com/sblocktechnologies/moonlight-fold) (sblocktechnologies) and [moonlight-android#1613](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android/pull/1613) |
| Send your microphone to the PC with any host: a VBAN stream to Starwire's receiver on the PC, which plays it into VB-Cable. Encrypted from 0.2.1, and only from devices you've paired with the PC; a "Not encrypted" option stays for Voicemeeter and other VBAN apps ([see above](#new-in-020-your-microphone-on-the-pc-with-any-host)). The receiver has no window, just an icon by the clock with pairing, a mic check and a test tone | New in Starwire, with its Windows receiver and setup script; VBAN is VB-Audio's network audio format |
| Or send it over the stream itself, with a choice of microphone **(needs [logabell's Apollo build](https://github.com/logabell/apollo-microphone/releases) on the PC)** | Ported from logabell's Artemis and moonlight-common-c microphone changes ([Artemis PR #537](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android/pull/537)); echo-cancelled capture is new in Starwire |
| Per-game settings for the new options (codec, V-Sync, LFR, async decode, display, touch mode, cursor, audio haptics, and the jitter buffer coming in 0.2.1) | Extends Moonlight X's per-app settings (MoreOrLessSoftware); the per-game jitter buffer is from Moonlight X too |

## More details

<details>
<summary><b>Device support</b></summary>

Starwire is built for Android 5.0 or newer, on any CPU type (64-bit and 32-bit ARM, and x86),
but the devices I test on run recent Android, so older versions haven't been tried. If something
breaks on yours, please open an issue. Some features need a recent device (async decoding, the
Vulkan renderer), and PyroWave and the custom Turnip driver option need a 64-bit ARM device
(`arm64-v8a`), since their libraries are only built for that. Updates install over the top with
your settings kept, as long as they come from these releases. Tools such as
[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) can keep it updated straight from the
Releases page.

The microphone's PC side (the receiver and its setup) needs Windows 10 or 11. Sending over the
stream instead needs logabell's Apollo build on the PC.

<details>
<summary><b>Check your download</b></summary>

Every Starwire release is signed with the same certificate. To check an APK before you install
it, use [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier) with:

```
com.starwire
B6:04:1D:43:9F:28:4F:17:16:64:6F:C0:F9:80:F1:9A:76:17:8F:A7:04:D5:6F:50:34:D4:06:2A:D3:C1:3F:97
```

Or on a computer, with `apksigner` from the Android SDK's build tools:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs Starwire-0.2.0.apk
```

The `certificate SHA-256 digest` line should read
`b6041d439f284f1716646fc0f980f19a76178fa704d56f5034d4062ad3c13f97`. That's the same
fingerprint as above, in lower case without the colons.

The Windows microphone zip isn't signed. GitHub lists each file's SHA-256 next to it on the
release page; in PowerShell, `Get-FileHash .\Starwire-Microphone-for-Windows.zip` should print
the same value.

<summary><b>Building from source</b></summary>

1. Install Android Studio (or just the Android SDK), a JDK 17 or newer (Android Studio comes with
   one), and the exact NDK version in `app/build.gradle`, currently 29.0.14206865. In Android
   Studio that's **SDK Manager → SDK Tools → NDK (Side by side)** with **Show Package Details**
   ticked; on the command line, `sdkmanager "ndk;29.0.14206865"`.
2. Clone with the submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SicarioGaming/Starwire.git
   ```
   Starwire uses its own fork of
   [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/SicarioGaming/moonlight-common-c) (branch `main`),
   which adds the calls for PC commands and Prevent Packet Loss, and logabell's in-stream
   microphone.
3. Tell Gradle where the Android SDK is: Android Studio writes `local.properties` with `sdk.dir=`
   when you open the project, or you can set `ANDROID_HOME`. Gradle finds the NDK inside the SDK
   folder.
4. Build a debug APK with `./gradlew assembleNonRootDebug`. It installs as "Starwire (Debug)"
   (`com.starwire.debug`), next to the release app.
5. Tests: `./gradlew testNonRootDebugUnitTest` runs the JVM tests on the computer, with no device.
   For the on-device tests, build the test APK too (`./gradlew assembleNonRootDebugAndroidTest`)
   and run `.github/tools/device-test.sh -s <serial>` with the device connected over adb.
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has more on the tests.

**Signed release builds** use a key that's never committed. Put its details in
`keystore.properties` in the project folder (it's in `.gitignore`):

```properties
storeFile=starwire-release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=starwire
keyPassword=...
```

or set `STARWIRE_KEYSTORE`, `STARWIRE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `STARWIRE_KEY_ALIAS` and
`STARWIRE_KEY_PASSWORD`. Then run `./gradlew assembleNonRootRelease`. Without a key, release
builds come out unsigned.

**Prebuilt libraries.** Gradle builds moonlight-common-c, the Vulkan renderer and the rest of
Starwire's native code from source. A few parts are committed already built instead:

- `app/src/main/jni/pyrowave/lib`: PyroWave, 64-bit ARM only. This is Moonlight X's file,
  unchanged. `SOURCE` names the upstream commit Moonlight X recorded for it.
  `build_libpyrowave.sh` builds that commit, but with the newer NDK this repo uses, so the
  result isn't byte-for-byte the same file. Rebuilt with Moonlight X's NDK 27 instead, it comes
  out the same apart from its build ID (checked on GitHub).
- `app/src/main/jni/adrenotools/lib`: libadrenotools and its four hook libraries, 64-bit ARM
  only, used only by the custom driver option. They were built with `build_libadrenotools.sh`
  from the upstream commits in `SOURCE`. Rebuilt from those commits with the original folder
  names mapped in, all five come out byte for byte the same.
- `app/src/main/jni/moonlight-core/opus` and `openssl`: static Opus and OpenSSL libraries, kept
  as they are from Moonlight.

The two scripts need CMake and Ninja, and `PYROWAVE_DIR` or `ADRENOTOOLS_DIR` set to your
checkout of the upstream source. [docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md) lists every committed
binary with its source, licence and SHA-256, and `.github/tools/prebuilts/verify.sh` rebuilds
them and compares the bytes.

The microphone receiver for Windows and its setup script are in [`windows/`](windows). There's
nothing to build there by hand: the setup compiles the receiver on the PC.
