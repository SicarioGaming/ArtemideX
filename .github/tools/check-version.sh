# Checks a release tag against Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and
# the rules in docs/dev/RELEASING.md ("Version numbers"), before the tag becomes a release.
#
#   bash .github/tools/check-version.sh --tag vX.Y.Z [--first-release]     (from the repo root)
#   bash .github/tools/check-version.sh --self-test
#
#   --tag        checks the commit of release vX.Y.Z: the tag's commit if the tag exists (and then
#                it has to be the one checked out), or else HEAD's. The files are read from that
#                commit, so changes that aren't committed don't count.
#                - the tag is "v" and a SemVer version. Build metadata (a "+..." part) isn't used.
#                - versionName in app/build.gradle is X.Y.Z, and versionCode is a whole number
#                  higher than it was at the previous release.
#                - CHANGELOG.md has a "## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD" heading and a "[X.Y.Z]: https://..."
#                  link. A pre-release, like v0.3.0-beta.1, skips this.
#                - .github/release-notes/vX.Y.Z-notes.md exists and isn't empty, for a pre-release
#                  too: the Release workflow publishes it for every tag.
#                - the bump fits the commits since the last release: a feat commit needs at least a
#                  MINOR bump, and so does a breaking one ("!" before the colon, or a
#                  "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer) while MAJOR is 0. From 1.0.0 on a breaking one needs
#                  MAJOR. A pre-release counts as the bump of the version it leads to. Commits with
#                  no type (upstream Moonlight X ones keep their own messages) can't be sorted, so
#                  a PATCH release gets a warning that lists them. A warning doesn't fail the check.
#                - the history is all there: a shallow clone, or no earlier release tag, is a
#                  problem, since then versionCode and the bump can't be compared.
#   --first-release  says there's no earlier release tag because this is the first release. It's a
#                problem if there is one.
#   --self-test  runs planted tags, versions and releases (in a throwaway repo in a temporary
#                folder) and says if any is classified wrong.
#
# The previous release is the highest tag below this one by SemVer precedence, among the tags
# named "v" and a SemVer version. Other tags, like moonlightx/v0.2.13 or v0.3-beta1, are ignored.
# The bump is measured from the last release that isn't a pre-release, since everything after it
# ships in this one. Merge commits are skipped, but not the commits they bring in.
# It only reads the repo: no network, no changes, and the same input always gives the same output.
# Exit 0 = fine, 1 = something to fix, 2 = usage error.
#
# Needs bash and git (both in Git for Windows). It avoids bash 4 features, so macOS's bash works.
